### Summary:
The focus of this project is to train an agent that can successfully complete MineRLNavigateDense-vO from the MineRL competition. In this task, the agent must navigate a forest with the goal of locating a diamond block. The block can be positioned below or above the level of the agent. The agent distinguishes the goal block based on unique visual features compared to surrounding blocks. We chose navigate dense as opposed to navigate, because the dense environment provides a positive/negative reward to the agent every tick based on it’s performance, while navigate is more sparse in it’s rewarding. There are readily available implementations that we can use as a resource in solving this problem, and our goal for this task is to improve upon these implementations to create a superior agent either by increasing it’s ability to reach the goal, or reducing the number of episodes necessary to converge.
